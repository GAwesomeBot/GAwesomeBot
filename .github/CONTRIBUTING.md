# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NZwzJ9Q) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the GAwesomeBot codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We generally use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that setup in your editor of choice is a great boon to your development process. Of course, this is optional.

## Setup
To get ready to gode on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **development** branch
2. Run `npm install`
3. Code your heart out!
4. Run the bot, and test that your changes work.
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/GilbertGobbels/GAwesomeBot/compare)
